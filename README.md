# Assembly-Image-Processing
This is my MIPS Assembly Language Image Processor that can shear, rotate, threshold, and more!

How to use:
1. Must have MIPS and MARS installed.
2. Have the "lab5" file in the same directory as the image "lenna".
3. Run the Assembly Code in MARS and check the directory of lab5 for the results!
